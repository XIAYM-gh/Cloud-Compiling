# Cloud-Compiling

A simple repository designed for myself.  
An easy way to compile maven / gradle based projects.  

Currently supports:

- [LeavesMC/Leaves](https://github.com/LeavesMC/Leaves) - applyPatches (Source generating)
- [VolmitSoftware/Iris](https://github.com/VolmitSoftware/Iris) - Plugin Building
- [aseprite/aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite) - C++ Windows x64 building *\(Private\)*

Note: "*\(Private\)*" means this builder will upload the artifacts to the `releases -> drafts` for some reason (e.g. EULA, restrictions), instead of uploading to `action -> artifacts`.

## How to use

Fork this repository, then enable GitHub Actions.  
Go to `Actions`, click the title in the sidebar, then click `Run Workflow`.  
If there're some options required, please fill them in.
